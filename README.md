## üöÄ What is STARK?

STARK is a high-performance, AI-native programming language designed to bridge the gap between AI research and production deployment. Built from the ground up for machine learning workflows, STARK combines the ease of Python with the performance of systems languages.

### Key Features

- **üß† AI-Native**: First-class tensor operations and ML primitives
- **‚ö° Blazing Fast**: Compiled to optimized machine code with JIT compilation
- **üîí Memory Safe**: Modern ownership model preventing common bugs
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Ready**: Built-in primitives for serverless and distributed computing
- **üéØ Type-Safe**: Strong static typing with inference for safety and productivity
- **üîÑ Concurrent**: Actor-based concurrency model for parallel ML workloads

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stark-lang/stark.git
cd stark-lang

# Run the setup script
chmod +x STARKLANG/stark-setup.sh
./STARKLANG/stark-setup.sh
```

## üéì Quick Start

### Hello World

```stark
fn main():
    print("Hello world")
```

### Tensor Operations

```stark
import tensor

fn matrix_multiply():
    let a = tensor.rand([1000, 1000])
    let b = tensor.rand([1000, 1000])
    let c = a @ b  // First-class matrix multiplication
    return c
```

### ML Pipeline Example

```stark
import ml.models
import ml.data

async fn train_model(dataset_path: str):
    // Load and preprocess data
    let dataset = await data.load(dataset_path)
    let (train, test) = dataset.split(0.8)
    
    // Define and train model
    let model = models.Transformer(
        layers: 12,
        hidden_dim: 768,
        heads: 12
    )
    
    model.train(train, epochs: 10, batch_size: 32)
    
    // Evaluate
    let accuracy = model.evaluate(test)
    print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

STARK features a modern compiler architecture:

- **Frontend**: Lexer, parser, and type checker
- **IR**: High-level intermediate representation optimized for ML operations
- **Backend**: LLVM-based code generation with custom ML optimizations
- **Runtime**: Lightweight VM with tensor-aware garbage collection
