# STARKLANG — The AI-Native, Cloud-First Programming Language 🚀

Welcome to **STARKLANG** — a high-performance, AI-native, cloud-first programming language built for intelligent concurrency, scalable execution, and modern developer experience.

---

## ✨ What is STARKLANG?
STARKLANG is designed from the ground up for the next generation of software development:
- Built-in support for AI/ML workloads (tensors, models, datasets)
- Asynchronous concurrency primitives (actors, channels, parallel patterns)
- Cloud-native deployment model (serverless, containerized, actor services)
- Strong static typing with ownership safety and polymorphism
- Hot-reload developer experience and modern CLI toolchain

---

## 🔥 Core Pillars
- ✅ **AI-Native**: ML pipelines, model training DSL, tensor ops
- ✅ **Cloud-First**: Serverless annotations, deployment descriptors, observability
- ✅ **Concurrency by Design**: Actors, async/await, channels, parallel map
- ✅ **Elegant Syntax**: Python readability + Rust/Go safety
- ✅ **Scalable Tooling**: Compiler, package manager, LSP-ready

---

## 🏗 Example: Hello STARK
```stark
fn main():
    print("Hello STARK World")
```

## 🧠 ML Pipeline DSL
```stark
ml_pipeline MyPipeline:
    load data from "data.csv"
    preprocess with Normalize, OneHotEncode
    train using DecisionTree(depth=5)
    validate with CrossValidation(folds=5)
    deploy as service "predictor"
```

## ☁️ Serverless API Example
```stark
@serverless
fn handle(input: JSON) -> JSON:
    return { "message": "Handled in the cloud" }
```

---

## 📦 Getting Started
```bash
stark init my-project
cd my-project
stark build
stark run
```
