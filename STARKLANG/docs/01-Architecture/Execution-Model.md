# ⚙ STARKLANG — Execution Model Specification

This document defines the Execution Model of STARKLANG, outlining how STARK source code transforms into runtime operations executed on STARKVM. It encompasses control flow mechanics, runtime orchestration, memory model, concurrency handling, and task scheduling.

---

## 📌 Design Goals

| Principle                     | Strategy |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Predictable Execution        | Stack-based bytecode engine |
| High-throughput concurrency  | Actor Model + Async Scheduler |
| Scalable parallelism         | Fork-Join, Channels, Pipelines |
| Observability built-in       | Tracing, logs, metrics via runtime hooks |
| Memory safety                | ARC + GC hybrid + ownership model |

---

## 🔀 Source-to-Execution Flow

```
STARK Source Code
  ↓
Compiler → AST → IR → Bytecode
  ↓
STARKVM Runtime
  ↓
Execution Engine (Stack + Scheduler + Heap)
```

---

## 🧠 Execution Unit: Instruction Frame

Each executing function runs in a lightweight instruction frame:

| Component       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Operand Stack  | LIFO structure for operands |
| Call Stack     | Function call frames (return address, locals) |
| Instruction Pointer | Tracks current bytecode position |
| Local Store    | Fast-access register bank or slots |
| Heap Allocations | Structs, arrays, tensors |

---

## 📎 Memory Segments

| Segment         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Stack           | Operand + control frames |
| Heap            | Dynamically allocated objects |
| Constants Pool  | Precompiled literals/constants |
| Globals Table   | Global vars / runtime-resolved bindings |

---

## 🔂 Execution Phases Per Frame

1. Instruction Fetch → Read next bytecode
2. Instruction Decode → Resolve opcode + operand
3. Dispatch Execution → Execute instruction logic
4. State Update → Update stack, heap, control flow
5. Context Switch (if needed) → Async suspend, actor yield

---

## 🔸 Runtime Components Overview

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Instruction Dispatcher | Core execution engine |
| Scheduler | Async task manager, work-stealing pool |
| Mailbox Engine | Actor system router |
| Tracer Engine | Hookable observability layer |
| Garbage Collector | Heap reclaim + cyclic GC |
| Profiler | Heatmap generator, stack timeline |

---

## 🔁 Execution Models Supported

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Sync Blocking | Traditional function calls |
| Async Non-blocking | async/await, Future<T> |
| Parallel Map/Reduce | parallel_map, parallel_reduce |
| Actor Message Loop | Actor-based isolated tasks |
| Event-driven | Triggers via system/cron/cloud events |

---

## 📡 Task Scheduling & Runtime Multithreading

STARKVM includes a task scheduler that handles:
- Async Tasks (Future<T>)
- Spawned workers
- Joinable task handles
- Actor dispatch queues

---

## 🔄 Concurrency Context Switching

| Scenario | Handling |
|---------|----------|
| await future | Suspends task frame, resumes on resolve |
| channel.recv() | Suspends until message is available |
| actor.send() | Message pushed to actor's mailbox queue |
| parallel_map() | Split into fork-join jobs |

---

## 🔒 Memory Safety Enforcement

- Multiple &T allowed (read-only borrow)
- One &mut T at a time (mutable borrow)
- Ownership/Move semantics enforced by compiler
- Heap-referenced memory tracked by ARC
- Cyclic data GC'd by fallback generational GC

---

## 📜 Example: Execution Snapshot

```stark
fn sum(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int:
    return a + b
```

Bytecode:
```
LOAD_VAR a
LOAD_VAR b
ADD
RETURN
```

---

## 🧪 Execution Modes

| Mode | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Interpreter | Default execution |
| Snapshot Replay | Fast boot from precompiled state |
| AOT/JIT Mode (Planned) | Hot-path compilation |

---

## 🔍 Runtime Observability Hooks

- log("message") → Standard console stream
- emit_metric("counter", value) → Metric stream
- trace_span("stage") → Tracing spans

---

## 📐 Execution DAG Model (Future)

Execution graph DAG for:
- Distributed execution
- Code auto-sharding
- Task placement intelligence

---

## 💥 Optimizations Enabled by Execution Model

| Optimization | Mechanism |
|--------------|----------|
| Tail-call elimination | Jump-based RETURN |
| Stack frame compaction | Slot-based frame reuse |
| Parallel map pipelining | Inlined loop transform |
| Borrow-elision | Compiler + runtime cooperation |
| Vectorized tensor ops | TENSOR_MAP + IR fusion |

---

| Async/Await | ✅ Integrated |
| Actor Runtime | ✅ Integrated |
| Parallel Scheduler | ✅ Drafted |
| Observability Hooks | ✅ Designed |
