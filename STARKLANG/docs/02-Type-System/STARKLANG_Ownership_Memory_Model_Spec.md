# üß† STARKLANG ‚Äî Ownership & Memory Model Specification

This document defines the hybrid **Ownership & Memory Management Model** for STARKLANG ‚Äî a system that combines the safety of **Ownership semantics** with the flexibility of **Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)** and the convenience of **Garbage Collection (GC)**.

The goal is to deliver **predictable performance, concurrency safety**, and **developer ergonomics** without compromising on expressiveness or scalability.

---

## üìå Core Philosophy

STARK‚Äôs memory model is designed for:

| Goal                      | Mechanism                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Safety                   | Ownership + Borrow Checking (Optional)     |
| Performance              | ARC with deterministic reference lifetimes |
| Flexibility              | Runtime GC for cyclic and shared objects   |
| Concurrency Support      | Isolated Thread Zones + Shared Safe Types  |
| Developer Simplicity     | Smart defaults + opt-in ownership rules    |

---

## üîÑ Memory Management Modes

### ‚úÖ **1. ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)** *(Default Mode)*

- All values tracked by reference count.
- Deterministic deallocation when count reaches 0.
- Suited for most common use-cases.

```stark
let profile = UserProfile(name="Alice")  // Auto-managed
```

---

### ‚ôª **2. GC Zone (Optional / Fallback)**

- Objects in a shared or cyclic graph are garbage-collected.
- GC activates only when ARC cannot determine safe deletion.

```stark
let node1 = Node()
let node2 = Node()
node1.link = node2
node2.link = node1  // GC handles this cycle
```

---

### üîê **3. Ownership Semantics (Advanced / Opt-in)**

STARK supports opt-in ownership for performance-sensitive code:

```stark
own let buffer = Buffer(size=1024)
```

- Moves ownership on assignment.
- Borrowing (`&buffer`) and mutable borrowing (`&mut buffer`) enabled.
- Ensures **compile-time safety** and **zero-cost abstraction**.

## üìé Variable Binding Rules

| Modifier | Description                     | Example                            |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `let`   | Immutable binding (default)     | `let x = 10`                      |
| `mut`   | Mutable binding                 | `mut let x = 10`; `x = 20`        |
| `own`   | Ownership-bound variable        | `own let buf = ...`               |

---

## üìö Borrowing Semantics

| Type         | Description                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `&T`         | Immutable borrow (read-only reference)    |
| `&mut T`     | Mutable borrow (write access, exclusive)  |

Rules:
- Multiple `&T` allowed simultaneously.
- Only **one `&mut T`** allowed at a time.
- Compiler enforces borrow checker rules.

---

## üß† Ownership Transfer

```stark
own let buf = Buffer()
fn write(buf: own Buffer):
    // Takes full ownership
```

- Once ownership is transferred, caller loses access.
- Use `clone()` to retain access.

---

## üîÑ Copy vs Move Semantics

| Type Class | Behavior            | Notes                              |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| Copyable   | Cheap bitwise copy  | Primitive types, small structs     |
| Movable    | Ownership transfer  | Buffers, Tensors, Structs          |
| Borrowable | Referenced with `&` | Default for large composite types |

---

## üßº Memory Safety Scenarios

| Pattern              | Behavior                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Shared Struct Access | ARC-managed with `clone()`     |
| Cyclic Structs       | GC fallback                    |
| Data Races           | Compile-time prevented via `&mut` rules |
| Dangling Pointers    | Not possible (no raw pointers) |

---

## üß™ Example: Safe Ownership Transfer

```stark
own let data = Buffer(size=512)

fn process(buf: own Buffer):
    // buf is now exclusively owned
    buf.write("Hello")

process(data)
// ‚ùå data no longer accessible here
```

---

## üß† Smart Defaults

| Situation                            | Behavior           |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Primitive Value Assignment          | Copy               |
| Structs without `own`               | Shared (ARC)       |
| Large mutable structures            | Require explicit `&mut` |
| GC Only Used For                    | Cycles + Soft references |

---

## üí° Runtime Optimizations

- Reference count elision during JIT compilation
- Borrowed references optimized via inlining
- Arena allocation for short-lived scopes

---

## üõ† Developer Tools

- **Memory Profiler**: Shows ARC/GC stats and lifetime graphs.
- **Ownership Linter**: Detects inefficient clones or unnecessary GC triggers.
- **Borrow Trace Visualizer** *(planned)*: Highlights reference flows in code.

---

## üî• Summary

STARK‚Äôs hybrid memory model combines:
‚úÖ Safety from Ownership/Borrowing  
‚úÖ Predictability from ARC  
‚úÖ Flexibility from GC fallback  

It‚Äôs a **next-gen memory management system** designed for **high-performance AI-native and concurrency-safe programming** ‚Äî without making developers wrestle with memory manually.
