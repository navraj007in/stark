# STARK Runtime Architecture — Memory Management Specification

## Overview
STARK’s memory management model is engineered for **predictability**, **performance**, and **developer safety**. It combines language-level constructs with runtime enforcement to allow precise control over memory usage without burdening developers with low-level details. The system is tightly integrated with the Garbage Collector (GC), Concurrency Engine, and Compiler IR.

STARK’s memory model draws from modern systems languages like Rust (ownership), Swift (ARC), and Go (simplicity), while introducing zone-based, actor-aware, and GPU-conscious memory semantics.

---

## Design Principles
- **Ownership-aware but ergonomic**
- **Reference-counted core with compiler-aided tracking**
- **Memory zones and task-scoped arenas**
- **Immutable-first by default, explicit mutability**
- **Zero-cost abstractions with predictable behavior**

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Ownership and Lifetimes**
Each variable in STARK has a single **owner**. The memory allocated to an object is cleaned when the owner’s lifetime ends or is explicitly reassigned.

```stark
let data = Dataset.load("data.csv")  // `data` owns the dataset
```

Ownership transfers automatically during assignments or scope moves.

```stark
let a = Tensor.ones([2, 2])
let b = a  // `a` is moved, ownership now belongs to `b`
```

---

### 2. **Immutability by Default**
```stark
let x = Tensor.range(0, 10)  // immutable
mutable let y = Tensor.zeros([5, 5])  // mutable
```
- Promotes safe-by-default coding.
- Compiler prevents mutation of immutable bindings.

---

### 3. **Reference Types and Cloning**
Explicit references are tracked using reference counts:
```stark
let x = Map()
let y = x.clone()  // Increments ref count
```

Use `WeakRef()` for non-owning references to avoid cycles.

---

### 4. **Memory Zones**
STARK divides heap memory into **zones**, categorized by task type or lifecycle:
- `global` — application-wide allocations
- `actor` — isolated per-actor/task/thread memory pools
- `tensor` — performance-optimized buffers for numerical ops
- `io` — stream, socket, and disk buffers

Zones enable localized GC sweeps and scoped cleanup strategies.

---

### 5. **Stack vs Heap Allocation**
- **Primitive types, Tuples, and small Structs** are stack-allocated.
- **Tensors, Datasets, Maps, Lists, Streams** are heap-allocated.
- Compiler promotes small structs to stack where possible (escape analysis).

---

### 6. **Arena Allocation Support**
```stark
arena task_scope:
    let buffer = Tensor.zeros([1000, 1000])
    let cache = Map()
```
Arena allocators improve performance by allocating memory in a single block, freed at once at the end of scope.

---

### 7. **Borrowing Semantics (Planned Extension)**
For deterministic lifetimes and zero-copy APIs, STARK will support optional **borrowing**:
```stark
fn operate(&tensor: Tensor):
    // borrowed, not owned — no ref increment
```
Borrowed values cannot outlive the owner’s scope.

---

## Compiler and GC Coordination
- Compiler inserts `incref`, `decref` ops into bytecode.
- GC metadata table maintains zone/ownership mapping.
- Cycle detection runs outside hot-path using parallel background sweep.

---

## Observability
```stark
Memory.profile() → MemoryStats
Memory.trace(zone="tensor")
Memory.usage_by_type()
```
Exposes:
- Zone-wise memory distribution
- Object counts per type
- Allocation/deallocation rates

---

## Best Practices
- Use `immutable let` wherever possible.
- Avoid cloning unless necessary — prefer transfer of ownership.
- Use `arena` blocks in high-volume loops.
- Monitor `Memory.profile()` in long-running apps or actor-based systems.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Region-based memory reclamation
- Lifetime annotations in function signatures
- Memory quota and sandboxing per actor/task
- Tensor memory pinning to specific devices (GPU, TPU)

---

## Summary
STARK’s memory management model empowers developers with high performance and low-footprint runtime guarantees without the overhead of manual memory control. From deterministic cleanup via reference counts to zone-aware optimization, STARK ensures your programs stay lean, safe, and fast—even at scale.
