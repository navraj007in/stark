# STARK Runtime Architecture — Garbage Collector (GC) Specification

## Overview
Memory management in STARK is designed to balance developer ergonomics, high-performance execution, and safe concurrency. The STARK Garbage Collector (GC) is a hybrid system combining **Reference Counting (RC)** for deterministic memory release and a **background Cycle Collector (CC)** to handle cyclic data structures and memory leaks.

This GC design ensures:
- Predictable low-latency behavior in latency-sensitive environments.
- Automatic cleanup of unreachable memory.
- Safe multi-threaded execution.
- Efficient handling of large AI/ML workloads and streaming data.

---

## Design Goals
- **Determinism:** Objects without cycles should be cleaned immediately.
- **Safety:** Thread-safe memory deallocation.
- **Scalability:** Efficient operation across multi-core and distributed environments.
- **Observability:** Built-in GC instrumentation and metrics hooks.

## GC Architecture Components

### 1. **Reference Counting (RC)**
- Each heap-allocated object holds a reference count (`ref_count`).
- Incremented on assignment/copy.
- Decremented on scope exit or mutation.
- Freed immediately when `ref_count == 0`.

#### Supported Object Types:
- Primitive composite types (List, Map, Tuple)
- Structs and Enums
- Tensors and Datasets (custom destructors supported)

### 2. **Cycle Detection / Cycle Collector (CC)**
- Runs as a low-priority background thread.
- Identifies and collects cyclic objects not reachable from root references.
- Uses the **trial deletion algorithm** or **graph coloring** for detection.

### 3. **Finalizers / Destructors**
```stark
struct FileHandle:
    path: String
    @destructor
    fn close():
        fs.close(path)
```
- User-defined destructors can be registered.
- Always called before memory is released.

### 4. **Weak References**
```stark
let weak_user = WeakRef(user)
if weak_user.exists():
    weak_user.get().name
```
- Do not affect reference count.
- Allow caches and observer patterns without memory leaks.

### 5. **Arena Allocation Support (Optional)**
- For short-lived batch-allocated memory blocks.
- Used for tensors, temporary matrices, intermediate pipeline buffers.

### 6. **GC Zones / Memory Regions**
- Memory is grouped by zone (e.g., `global`, `task`, `actor`, `tensor`).
- Enables selective GC sweep and localized deallocation.

## GC Runtime Behavior
### Deterministic Cleanup (RC Path):
- Immediate on `ref_count == 0`
- Suitable for microservices, low-latency compute, embedded tasks

### Deferred Cleanup (CC Path):
- Periodically triggered (based on allocation threshold, idle time, memory pressure)
- Custom tunables via `GC.config()`

### Example:
```stark
GC.config({
    cycle_interval: 100ms,
    threshold_bytes: 50MB,
    zone_priority: ["actor", "tensor", "global"]
})
```

---

## Observability & Diagnostics
- `GC.trace()` — enables GC-level trace logging
- `GC.stats()` — memory usage snapshot
- `GC.zones()` — live objects by zone
- `GC.profile()` — time spent in GC phases

```stark
let snapshot = GC.stats()
log(snapshot.memory_used, snapshot.cycles_collected)
```

---

## Multi-threaded Support
- RC operations are atomic.
- Per-thread allocation pools reduce contention.
- GC Zones tied to task/actor lifecycle.
- CC uses lock-free data collection queues.

---

## Compiler Integration
- RC instrumentation is handled at **bytecode generation phase**.
- Special opcodes: `incref`, `decref`, `check_cycle`, `gc_hint`
- SSA/IR annotations track object lifetimes and ownership.

---

## Advanced Concepts (Future Work)
- **Generational GC Modes**
- **Escape Analysis & Static GC bypassing** for hot paths
- **Memory budgeting API per actor/task**
- **Region-based deallocation syntax (RAII-inspired)**

---

## Summary
The STARK GC architecture blends low-latency deterministic RC with adaptive background CC to ensure safety, scalability, and performance. With built-in instrumentation, thread-safe zones, and compiler-assisted memory management, STARK provides a truly modern and developer-transparent GC system optimized for the AI-native, cloud-first future.
