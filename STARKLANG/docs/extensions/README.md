# STARK Extensions

## Overview
Extensions define non-core language features that may evolve independently of Core v1. Implementations MAY support extensions, but Core v1 conformance does not require them.

## Policy
- Each extension MUST be documented in this directory.
- Extensions SHOULD be versioned independently from Core v1.
- Extensions MUST NOT change the behavior of Core v1 features unless explicitly specified.
- Implementations claiming extension support MUST document the supported extension versions and any deviations.

## Current Extensions
- `AI-Extensions.md`
