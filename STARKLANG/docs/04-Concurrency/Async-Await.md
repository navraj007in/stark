# ⚡ STARKLANG — `async/await` Specification

This document defines the syntax, behavior, type system integration, and runtime model for `async/await` constructs in STARKLANG. These constructs form the foundation for non-blocking, lightweight, and scalable asynchronous programming across AI, cloud-native, and distributed systems.

---

## 📌 Why `async/await`?

| Benefit                  | Explanation |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Non-blocking execution   | Prevents thread starvation |
| Readable async code      | Flat control flow, no callbacks |
| Lightweight fibers       | Optimized runtime tasks instead of threads |
| Type-safe concurrency    | Integrates with `Future<T>` |
| Composable workflows     | Enables async pipelines and task chaining |

---

## 🔣 Syntax Overview

### ✅ Declaring an `async` function
```stark
async fn fetch_data(url: String) -> Response:
    let result = http.get(url)
    return result
```

### ✅ Using `await` to retrieve result
```stark
let response: Response = await fetch_data("https://api.stark.ai")
```

### ✅ Chaining async tasks
```stark
let result = await fetch_data(url).then(parse_json).then(process_data)
```

## 🧠 Type System Integration

| Expression                | Type              |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| async fn foo() -> Int     | Future<Int>       |
| let x = await foo()       | Int               |
| async let x = foo()       | Future<T> (lazy)  |

### Optional: `async let` (planned)
```stark
async let task1 = compute_one()
async let task2 = compute_two()

let result1 = await task1
let result2 = await task2
```

## 🌀 `Future<T>` API

| Method         | Description                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| .await()       | Wait for result (syntax sugar)  |
| .then(fn)      | Chain next action               |
| .catch(fn)     | Handle failure (planned)        |
| .map(fn)       | Transform result (lazy)         |

---

## 🧭 Task Lifecycle

| Stage         | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Created       | Future declared                      |
| Scheduled     | Task registered with async scheduler |
| Suspended     | Await point reached                  |
| Resumed       | Task resumed when result ready       |
| Completed     | Final value returned or error raised |

---

## 🏗 Runtime Model

STARKLANG async tasks are executed by a Task Scheduler inside the runtime (STARKVM), using:
- Coroutine-based fibers
- Event loop + polling system
- Work-stealing for parallel execution

---

## 📦 Example: Full Async Flow
```stark
async fn load_user(id: Int) -> User:
    let json = await http.get("/api/users/" + str(id))
    return parse_user(json)

async fn process():
    let user = await load_user(42)
    print("User: " + user.name)
```

---

## ⏱ Concurrency with `spawn` + `await`
```stark
let handle = spawn load_user(42)
let user = await handle.join()
```

---

## ✅ Error Handling in Async
```stark
async fn risky_task() -> Result<Int, String>:
    if fail:
        return Err("Failed!")
    return Ok(42)

let result = await risky_task()
match result:
    Ok(v) => print(v)
    Err(e) => print("Error: " + e)
```

---

## 🧪 Best Practices

| Practice | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Avoid nested awaits | Use chaining or `async let` instead |
| Prefer spawn for long tasks | Keeps main async loop responsive |
| Handle errors explicitly | Avoid unhandled futures |
| Use async IO APIs | Non-blocking end-to-end |

---

## 🛠 Developer Tooling (Planned)

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| Task Profiler | Track active/suspended tasks |
| Await Tree Visualizer | View async call graph |
| Deadlock Detector | Analyze unresolved futures |

---
