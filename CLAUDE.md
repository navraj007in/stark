# STARK Language Project - Claude AI Assistant Context

## Project Overview

**STARK** (**S**calable **T**ensor-Aware **R**eactive **K**ernel) is an AI-native programming language designed for production ML deployment, bridging the gap between AI research and real-world performance.

### Vision Statement

In a world where Python dominates AI research but fails in production, where inference costs spiral out of control, and where edge deployment means sacrificing model capabilities, STARK rises as the bridge between AI innovation and real-world performance.

## Core Language Specifications

### 1. Language Design Philosophy

- **AI-Native**: Tensor operations and ML workflows as primary abstractions
- **Production Performance**: 2-10x faster inference than Python with memory safety
- **Python Interoperability**: Seamless loading of existing PyTorch/TensorFlow models
- **Memory Safety**: Prevent common memory errors through ownership and borrowing
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features without runtime overhead

### 2. Type System

```stark
// Tensor types with compile-time shape checking
let matrix: Tensor<f32, [1024, 768]> = Tensor::zeros();
let batch: Tensor<f32, [32, 3, 224, 224]> = load_images();

// AI-native type inference
let model = load_pytorch_model("resnet50.pt");  // Type inferred from model
let predictions = model.predict(batch);         // Shape validated at compile time
```

**Key Features:**
- Compile-time tensor shape inference and validation
- Generic tensor types with device and precision specifications
- Automatic broadcasting and shape coercion
- AI/ML specific primitive types (Model, Dataset, Optimizer)

### 3. Memory Model

**Hybrid Memory Management System:**
- **Owned Memory**: Zero-cost tensor operations with predictable layout
- **Garbage Collection**: High-level objects and complex data structures
- **Ownership & Borrowing**: Rust-inspired safety with ML-focused relaxations

```stark
// Stack-allocated and owned (zero-cost)
let tensor = Tensor::<f32, [1024, 1024]>::zeros();  // Stack metadata, owned data

// Garbage-collected (managed)
let model = torch::load_model("resnet50.pt");       // GC-managed complex object
let cache: Map<str, Model> = Map::new();           // GC-managed collections
```

### 4. Concurrency Model

**Actor-Based System with Async/Await:**
- Structured concurrency with automatic cleanup
- Message passing for safe concurrent state management
- ML-optimized patterns for data/model parallelism
- Work-stealing scheduler for efficient load balancing

```stark
// Training pipeline with structured concurrency
async fn ml_training_pipeline() {
    let training_scope = async_scope! {
        let data_loader = spawn_task("data", async {
            load_and_preprocess_data("train.csv").await
        });
        
        let model = spawn_task("model", async {
            create_and_initialize_model(&config).await
        });
        
        let (dataset, model) = join!(data_loader, model);
        let trainer = TrainingActor::new(model?, dataset?);
        trainer.start_training(epochs: 100).await
    };
    
    training_scope.await?;
}
```

### 5. Error Handling System

**Type-Safe Result/Option Types:**
- Explicit error handling with the `?` operator
- ML-specific error hierarchies (TensorError, ModelError, TrainingError)
- Rich error context and chaining
- Production features: circuit breakers, retry mechanisms

```stark
async fn ml_pipeline() -> Result<TrainingMetrics, MLError> {
    let dataset = Dataset::load("train.csv")?;
    let model = Model::from_config(&config)?;
    
    let metrics = train_model(model, dataset)
        .await
        .context("Failed to train model")?;
    
    save_model(&model, "model.onnx")
        .or_else(|e| {
            warn!("Primary save failed: {e}, trying backup");
            save_model(&model, "backup/model.onnx")
        })?;
    
    Ok(metrics)
}
```

### 6. Module System & Package Manager

**Hierarchical Modules with Semantic Versioning:**
- Explicit import/export declarations
- Package.stark manifest with comprehensive dependency management
- Security-first design with package signing and vulnerability scanning
- Multi-registry support (public, private, corporate)

```stark
// Package.stark manifest
[package]
name = "stark-cv"
version = "0.3.1"
description = "Computer Vision library for STARK"

[dependencies]
stark-std = "1.0"
